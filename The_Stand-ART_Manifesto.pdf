# The Stand-ART Manifesto

## 1. Introduction

Throughout history, artists and creators have operated within tightly controlled systems, dependent on access to capital, networks, and institutional recognition. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies presents, for the first time, an opportunity to radically disrupt and transcend these legacy structures.

This document formally introduces and defines The Stand-ART System and The Autonomous Artist OS: a complete philosophical and technological framework empowering individual creators or micro-studios to design, produce, and distribute fully realized artistic works—including animation, digital fashion, music, and video—with minimal external dependency and at an unprecedented scale.

The purpose of this Manifesto is to establish the first global public record of the concepts, definitions, and architectural principles underpinning Stand-ART. It serves as a declaration of independence for the Autonomous Artist: the creator who utilizes AI and automated pipelines not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a vehicle to amplify agency, reclaim ownership, and overcome systemic barriers.

In a global context where legal, academic, and industrial frameworks have yet to fully comprehend or address the societal implications of AI-driven artistic autonomy, this document acts as a foundational text. It proposes a new standard of intellectual sovereignty for creators operating within the attention economy.

Authored by EYOG YVON LEONCE, Founder of La Maison des Masques, SoulArtSpace, HiringWatchDog, AlmaReina, and Beersheba MorgenRot, this Manifesto establishes the priority claim and defines the conceptual and terminological basis of what is hereafter known as The Stand-ART Era.
